# jmxdump-analyzer
The JMXDump Analyser Utility is a small, internal-only, self-contained JavaFX application which allows you to open an Alfresco 'JMX dump' file and will split the contents in manageable tabs. Highlighting the important stuff first and then breaking down the settings into the relevant topics, the utility makes JMX dumps much easier to read!
